**README**

This repository contains code for solving complex numerical, logical, and algorithmic questions using advanced techniques such as prompt engineering and chain of thought, with the aim of improving the performance of Language Model (LLM) systems. The provided code is specifically designed for solving such tasks where traditional LLMs struggle due to the requirement of logical thinking and problem-solving skills.

**File Structure:**
- `zero_shot_qna.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook contains the code for solving the numerical questions using the Google Generative AI platform.
- `TestSet.csv`: This CSV file contains the test set consisting of question.
- `zero_shot.csv`: This CSV file contains the output predictions generated by the model.

**Dependencies:**
- Google Generative AI: The code relies on the Google Generative AI platform for generating responses to the provided prompts.
- pandas: This library is used for reading and writing CSV files, as well as for data manipulation.
- re: The regular expressions module is used for extracting numerical values from generated responses.

**Instructions for Use:**
1. Install the required dependencies mentioned in the code.
2. Make sure to have the Google API key configured properly for using the Google Generative AI platform.
3. Run the provided Jupyter Notebook (`zero_shot_qna.ipynb`) in a compatible environment (e.g., Google Colab) to execute the code.
4. Ensure that the `TestSet.csv` file is in the same directory as the notebook.
5. Execute the code cells sequentially to perform the following tasks:
   - Split the test set data into two parts.
   - Process each part separately to predict answers for the questions.
   - Generate an output file (`zero_shot.csv`) containing the predicted answers.
6. Review the generated output file for evaluation.

**Note:**
- Due to the nature of the problem and the computational resources required, it's recommended to run the code on platforms like Google Colab for efficient processing.
- Error handling mechanisms are implemented to address potential issues such as non-numeric or overflow values during prediction.
- The code is designed to leverage advanced techniques like prompt engineering and chain of thought to enhance the accuracy of predictions for complex numerical questions.
- This model brought a score of 2.363 (RMLE) in the leaderboard.
